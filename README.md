## General

### Background
In this notbook we take another look into deep learning, this time into double decent and rademacher complexity.In Exerice 1 we comapre rademacher complexity between diffrent activation functions.In the second exerice to goal is to create double decent and to invetigate what effects it.

#### About The Classifiers
As in the comparssion we compare between the activation function and the number of layer the optimizer function and the loss function are the same between them in order to isolate the effect of the compared attribute. The comparison is made between activation functions:
* ```Relu```: 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{black}\large{Relu(x)=max(0,x)})	
* ```TanH``` : 
![equation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8e81902c8d71b06c246769bad0fe17c9cf1efd9)

***
The comparison is between 2,3 and 4 layers because the baseline was 3 and I wanted to check the effect of adding and removing one layer. Finnaly as we have 2 choosies for activation function and 3 for n
 
### Program Structure
Exerice 1 is divded to servel parts. The first part is creating the the train and test function which will be used by each classifier to train and test its performence.The next part is defining the diffrent classifiers and running train and test on them. At last, there is comprassion between the the layers number selecting the best one and similar process for the activation function. 

In Exerice 2, a similar procces is contsructed.After deffining the needed train and test function we run on a large number of epochs and watch the effect on train and test loss.

### Running Instructions
After donwloading the file on colab. Press on file -> open nootbook -> Upload and then drop to downloaded file.

Now you can run the whole nootbok or specfic cells.


## Installation
I will use google as an example but similar procces can be prefomred on other nootbook editors
1. Open google colab
2. Clone the project by:
	```
	!git clone https://github.com/elaysason/Deep-Learning-Comparining-Overfitting
.git
	```

3. Now the folder is in your files on colab. simpily download the nootbook as showed

## Footnote:
The paramters which wasn't comppared in Exerice 1 was determinted from the baseline case which was given.
